        <h2 class = "text-primary">My beginning</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Nigeria, surrounded by lively culture, family traditions, and a strong sense of community. Those early years taught me resilience, learning, and the importance of togetherness. These values continue to guide me every day.</p>

        <h2>My Family</h2>
        <p>Life blessed me with a loving husband and three wonderful children; a son (19) and two daughters (17 and 14).Motherhood has been the most rewarding part of my journey. From cooking together to laughing over movies or just spending time side by side, my family truly brings life and love to my story. Above all, I am a lover of God, and my faith is the foundation that guides how I live, love, and nurture my family.</p>

        <h2>My Interest</h2>
        <p>I find joy in cooking.It's my favorite way to be creative. I love trying out new recipes and mixing Nigerian flavors with fresh ideas. Traveling excites me, even though I usually end up feeling a bit under the weather afterward. Still, the adventure of discovering new places is always worth it. When I'm at home, nothing beats relaxing with my kids, trying new recipes, sharing meals and enjoying a good movie.</p>

        <h2>My Education and Work</h2>
        <p>My academic path took me deep into computer science, earning a PhD, MSc, and BSc from Nnamdi Azikiwe University in Nigeria. Professionally, I've worked in academic administration and teaching, and now I'm embracing a new chapter: Full Stack Development. I'm currently training with Making Changes Association in Calgary, mastering tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, FlexBox, JavaScript, Python, SQL, React, Node.js, Firebase, and UX/UI design. It's a thrilling transition into tech, where I blend problem solving with creativity.</p>

        <h2>Relocation</h2>
        <p>On June 5, 2025, My family relocated to Canada. It hasn't always been rosy, phew... adjusting to a new country, culture, and way of life came with its challenges. Yet, the journey has also been amazing, filled with moments of discovery, the warmth of Calgary, and fresh opportunities to grow. Each day brings lessons, resilience, and a sense that I'm building something new and meaningful.</p>
